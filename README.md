# YouTube Video End Time Calculator Calculator

Your time is valuable, and while you may not notice just how much time passes by when you're browsing YouTube, seeing the estimated end time of a video may make you more aware.

YouTube Video End Time Calculator is a browser extension for Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge (Chromium) that calculates and displays the estimated end time of a YouTube video. It adds a new element to the seek bar, next to where YouTube shows the duration and current position of the video, that displays the time when the video is estimated to end based on the current playback position and duration.

3. Enable developer mode by clicking the toggle switch.
4. Click the "Load unpacked" button.
5. Select the directory where you downloaded the source code and click "Select folder".

## Usage

Once installed, YouTube Video End Time Calculator will automatically add the estimated end time element to the seek bar of any YouTube video you watch. The estimated end time will be updated as you watch the video, and will change based on your current position in the video.
